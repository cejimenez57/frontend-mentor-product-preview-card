# Frontend Mentor - Product preview card component

![Design preview for the Product preview card component coding challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

## The challenge

Your challenge is to build out this product preview card component and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

Your users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for interactive elements

## My Solution

- Made this entirely using flexbox and SASS. Some basic markup HTML and the rest was SASS.
- Built in media query for only one break point.
